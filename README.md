# Overview

This program is a simple calculator with four basic operators. It asks to enter the first number, then the operator and the second number. After that it gives the result and asks if there is anything else to calculate. The program also has input validation.

The program was written to learn the basics of Kotlin and understand how its syntax differs from familiar languages.

# Development Environment

This work required Visual Studio Code with the environment for the Kotlin language installed on it.
Also required resources with manuals on the basics of Kotlin.

# Future Work

- Add more operators: modulus (%), exponentiation (^), or square root (sqrt).
- Round output to two decimal places.
- Change the console prompt output so that they don't merge with each other.
